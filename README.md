# PriceBot

This bot uses YOLO trained on a dataset with images of prices in georgian stores. 

There are two models here, each was trained for a different store. mAP50-95 score of the first model "Nikora" is 0.902 for all classes, mAP50-95 score of the second model "Universami" is 0.836 for all classes.

For text recognition I use Pytesseract.
